# All You Have to Know About Conditionals

## What is an Algorithm?
An algorithm is a set of steps used to complete a specific task. It serves as a building block for programming. Algorithms allow computers, smartphones, and websites to function and make decisions.

**Example: A Cooking Recipe**

## Flow of Control
Flow of control refers to the order in which a program performs actions. Typically, the execution follows a **sequential** order. However:
- A **branching statement** chooses between two or more possible actions.
- A **loop statement** repeats an action until a stopping condition occurs.

## Flow Charts
A **flow chart** is a graphical representation of an algorithm using various symbols to depict different types of actions or decisions. It helps in visually understanding the flow of logic in a program.

### Common Flow Chart Symbols:
- **Oval**: Represents the start or end of the process.
- **Rectangle**: Represents a process or instruction.
- **Diamond**: Represents a decision (e.g., an `if` condition).
- **Arrows**: Indicate the flow of control.

### Example: Rolling a Die (Flow Chart)

## Pseudocode
**Pseudocode** describes an algorithm using structured, human-readable steps without the strict syntax of a programming language. It helps in planning logic before coding.

### Example:
```plaintext
START
SET roll to a random number between 1 and 6
PRINT roll
IF roll is greater than 3 THEN
    PRINT "You won!"
ELSE
    PRINT "Sorry, you lost."
END IF
END
```
Pseudocode is useful for designing logic before implementation in actual programming languages.

## The Basic `if()` Statement
```java
if (condition) {
    statement(s) to perform when the condition is true
}
```
- The **condition** is usually a comparison.
- A true-or-false comparison is also known as a **Boolean expression**, named after **George Boole (1815-1864).**

### Relational Operators:
- `>` Greater than
- `<` Less than
- `>=` Greater than or equal to
- `<=` Less than or equal to
- `!=` Not equal to
- `==` Equal to (not to be confused with `=`, the assignment operator)

### True or False?
Evaluate the following expressions:
- `2 > 5`
- `3 < 10`
- `2 >= 2`
- `5 <= 10`
- `4 != 5`
- `7 == 7`

## Rolling a Die: Code Example
```java
int roll;
roll = int(random(1, 7));
println("Roll: " + roll);
if (roll > 3) {
    println("You win!");
}
```

## Common Pitfalls with Conditionals
### Using `=` instead of `==`
In many programming languages:
- `=` is used for **assignment**.
- `==` is used for **comparison**.

**Incorrect Code:**
```java
int x = 5;
if (x = 10) {  // This will cause an error!
    println("x is 10");
}
```

### Forgetting Curly Braces `{}`:
If you omit curly braces, only the first statement after the `if` executes.

```java
if (x > 5)
    println("x is greater than 5");  // This executes
    println("This will always execute!");  // Always executes, even if the condition is false.
```

## The `if`-`else` Statement
```java
if (condition) {
    // Statement(s) to perform if the condition is true
} else {
    // Statement(s) to perform if the condition is false
}
```

## Rolling a Die: Updated Code
```java
int roll;
roll = int(random(1, 7));
println("Roll: " + roll);
if (roll == 6) {
    println("You won!");
} else {
    println("Sorry, you lost.");
}
```

## Nested `if-else-if` Statements

## Logical Operators:
### AND (`&&`)
Sometimes two (or more) conditions must be **true** before executing a statement.
```plaintext
Example: You are older than 16 **AND** you have a permit â†’ You can drive.
```

### OR (`||`)
Example in Processing:
```java
if (mouseX < width/3 || mouseX > 2 * width/3) {
    background(255);
} else {
    background(0);
}
```

## Negation Logical Operator (`!`)
In **Processing**, the **negation logical operator** (`!`) inverts the Boolean value of an expression. It returns:
- `true` if the operand is `false`
- `false` if the operand is `true`

### Example: Checking User Login
```java
String username = "admin";
String password = "password123";

if (username.equals("admin") && password.equals("password123")) {
    println("Login successful!");
} else {
    println("Invalid username or password.");
}
```

### Example:
```java
void setup() {
    boolean isRaining = false;
    println("Is it raining? " + isRaining);

    // Using the negation operator
    boolean notRaining = !isRaining;
    println("Is it NOT raining? " + notRaining);
}
```
#### Output:
```
Is it raining? false
Is it NOT raining? true
```

## Practice Exercise
Write a program that checks if a number is **even or odd** using an `if-else` statement.

**Hint**: Use the **modulo operator** `%`.

---

## Definition of the `%` (Modulo) Operator
The **modulo operator** (`%`) in Processing returns the **remainder** of division between two numbers.

### Syntax:
```java
result = a % b;
```
- `a` is the **dividend**.
- `b` is the **divisor**.
- The result is the remainder when `a` is divided by `b`.

### Example:
```java
void setup() {
    int a = 10;
    int b = 3;
    int remainder = a % b;

    println("10 % 3 = " + remainder);  // Output: 10 % 3 = 1
}
```
#### Explanation:
- `10 / 3 = 3` (quotient), with a remainder of `1`.
- `10 % 3` results in `1`.

### Solution:
```java
int number = 7;
if (number % 2 == 0) {
    println("The number is even.");
} else {
    println("The number is odd.");
}
```

## Boolean Variables
Boolean variables store results of conditions:

```java
int age = (int) random(100);
boolean adult = (age > 21);
```
