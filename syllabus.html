    <h3>Course Description</h3>
    <p>
This course provides an introduction to Computer Science and programming, focusing on programming as the foundation for understanding and exploring the world of computers. Students will learn essential programming concepts and develop coding skills through hands-on practice.
The course is designed to be flexible and adaptive to the needs of students, whether they are majoring in Mathematics/Computer Science or coming from other disciplines. We will begin with simple programming assignments, gradually building toward more complex tasks. 
        By the end of the semester, students will work on individualized projects that showcase their acquired skills and align with their personal interests or academic focus.<br/>
Our primary programming language will be <strong>Processing</strong>, a Java-based language with its own Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Processing is widely recognized for its versatility and accessibility, making it an excellent choice for beginners and those interested in creative coding applications.

    
    </p>
    <h3>Course Goals</h3>
    <p>This course has two goals: to teach students to "talk to the computers in the computer's own language" and to prepare Math/CS majors for Computer Science 2 and upper-level electives.</p>
<h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
    <p>Upon completion of this course, successful students should be able to</p>
   <ul>
  <li>Use basic computer terminology</li>
  <li>	Understand Processing syntax including
    <ul>
      <li>variables and data types</li>
      <li>conditionals</li>
      <li>loops</li>
      <li>arrays</li>
      <li>strings</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Learn how to handle images and program simple animations</li>
  <li>Make the programs interactive</li>
  <li>Understand the ideas of Object-Oriented programming including</li>
       <ul>
           <li>classses</li>
           <li>methods</li>
           <li>basics of inheritance</li>
       </ul>
  <li>Do basic debugging</li>
 
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Required Textbook</h3>
    <p>Daniel Shiffman<br/>
Learning Processing: A Beginner's Guide to Programming Images, Animation, and Interaction (Morgan Kaufmann Series in Computer Graphics), Second Edition, website:<a href="http://learningprocessing.com/" target="_blank">http://learningprocessing.com/</a>.
You can check out an e-copy of this book from the library. Details are on Brightspace.
We will also use online Processing references at <a href="https://processing.org/reference/" target="_blank">https://processing.org/reference/</a>.
</p>
    <h3>Required Software</h3>
    <p>To develop and run programs, you will need Processing installed on your computer. To download the latest version of it, go to <a href="https://processing.org/download/" target="_blank">https://processing.org/download/</a>.

     </p>
    
    <h3>Collaboration Policy</h3>
 <p>You are encouraged to discuss homework assignments and problem sets with other students. You must complete the assignment on your own, however.
     There is a clear difference between copying someone else’s work and discussing a problem with another person. The latter is encouraged.
     Plagiarizing another student’s work can lead to academic sanctions as per <a href="https://www.purchase.edu/live/blurbs/840-academic-and-professional-integrity" target="_blank"> Purchase College’s Academic Integrity Policy </a>
 We take cheating seriously!
    </p>
    <h3>Accessibility Statement</h3>
    <p>It is my goal that this class be an accessible and a welcoming experience for all students, including those with disabilities.
        You are welcome to talk to me at any point in the semester about course design concerns, but it is always best if we can talk as soon as possible
        about the need for any modifications. The Office of Disability Resources collaborates directly with students who identify documented
        disabilities to create accommodation plans, including testing accommodations, for students to access course content and validly demonstrate
        learning. For those students who may require accommodations, please call or email the Office of Disability Resources, (914) 251-6035,
        <a href="mailto:odr@purchase.edu">odr@purchase.edu</a>.</p>

    <h3>Mental Health and Well-Being</h3>
    <p> College faculty and staff recognize that mental health and stress can impact college performance and interfere with daily life activities. 
        At Purchase, Counseling & Behavioral Health Services can provide support if you’re struggling with feeling overwhelmed, anxious, 
        depressed, lost, stuck, or in a crisis. Please call (914)251-6390 or visit <a href="" target="_blank">Counseling and Behavioral Health Services (CBHS)</a> 
        for more information. CBHS services are free and confidential. </br>
    We support all students experiencing emergencies. Services include therapy, support groups, stress reduction at the Harbor Center, and other activities.  The Counseling Center in Humanities Lower Level is open M-F, from 9:00 a.m.– 5:00 p.m. for appointments and walk-up scheduling, or call (914) 251-6390.  The Harbor Center Sanctuary in Fort Awesome is available for stress reduction, mindfulness, and meditation training, free drop-in classes and support groups, and relaxation.
</p>
    <h3>Tutoring Support</h3>
    <p>Tutoring is available in Einstein Corner located in the Natural Science Building, room 3046. Students can schedule appointments through the Starfish platform.  </p>
    <h3>  Course Load and Grade Allocation </h3>
    <p>
    There will be a midterm exam, a midterm project, and a final project. The final grade will be computed taking into consideration:
    <ul>
  <li>30% Programming exercises/homework assignments/class participation</li>
 <li>20% Midterm project/presentation </li>
 <li>10% Midterm exam </li>
        <li>25% Final project/presentation/report  </li>
        <li>15% Non-programming assignments and quizzes </li>   
    </ul>
    Showing me your neat and complete lecture notes before the end of the semester will add 5 points to your final score. <br/>

    <h3>Tentative Nature of Syllabus</h3>
    <p>If needed, this syllabus, grade allocation, and course outline may be revised to better suit the class. Students are responsible for keeping up with any changes distributed via email or in class. The most up-to-date syllabus will always be posted on Brightspace.</p>
    <h3>Cell Phone Policy During the Class</h3>
    <p>Cellphones are like toddlers—always looking for trouble—so keep them silenced and out of sight during class. If your phone rings, you’ll owe us a performance (karaoke, anyone?). Emergencies are the only exception, but Instagram and memes can wait—focus on the real learning happening here! 📵</p>
