    <h3>Course Description</h3>
    <p>
This course provides an introduction to Computer Science and programming, focusing on programming as the foundation for understanding and exploring the world of computers. Students will learn essential programming concepts and develop coding skills through hands-on practice.
The course is designed to be flexible and adaptive to the needs of students, whether they are majoring in Mathematics/Computer Science or coming from other disciplines. We will begin with simple programming assignments, gradually building toward more complex tasks. 
        By the end of the semester, students will work on individualized projects that showcase their acquired skills and align with their personal interests or academic focus.<br/>
Our primary programming language will be <strong>Processing</strong>, a Java-based language with its own Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Processing is widely recognized for its versatility and accessibility, making it an excellent choice for beginners and those interested in creative coding applications.

    
    </p>
    <h3>Course Goals</h3>
    <p>This course has two goals: to teach students to "talk to the computers in the computer's own language" and to prepare Math/CS majors for Computer Science 2 and upper-level electives.</p>
<h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
    <p>Upon completion of this course, successful students should be able to</p>
   <ul>
  <li>Use basic computer terminology</li>
  <li>	Understand Processing syntax including</li>
    <ul>
      <li>variables and data types</li>
      <li>conditionals</li>
      <li>loops</li>
      <li>arrays</li>
      <li>strings</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Learn how to handle images and program simple animations</li>
  <li>Make the programs interactive</li>
  <li>Understand the ideas of Object-Oriented programming including</li>
       <ul>
           <li>classses</li>
           <li>methods</li>
           <li>basics of inheritance</li>
       </ul>
  <li>Do basic debugging</li>
 
</ul>
<h3>Required Textbook</h3>
    <p><a href="https://openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-2" target="_blank">Calculus Volume 2 by Edwin Herman and Gilbert Strang</a>. This textbook is available for free online and can be downloaded as a PDF or for Kindle.

</p>
    <h3>Required Software</h3>
    <p>For written homework assignments, students will need to use either a scanner app or a scanner to create a <strong>single PDF</strong> of all
        their work and upload the work to Brightspace. There are several good scanner apps available for Android and iOS devices, my favorite is 
        CamScanner (Android / iOS).</p>
    <p>Another option to submit your written assignments is to use LaTeX. Here are <a href="https://irinashab.github.io/calc2-spring2025/software.html">the details</a>. </p>
<h3>MyOpenMath Online Homework</h3>
  <p>We will be using the <a href="https://www.myopenmath.com/" target="_blank"> MyOpenMath </a> website for online homework. Please register ASAP using the Course ID and Enrollment Key are provided <a href="https://irinashab.github.io/calc2-spring2025/mom.html"> here </a>.
      Make sure to use your name and Purchase College email address</p>  
    <h3>Calculator Policy</h3>
    <p>A graphing calculator is required for this course. You are welcome to use online calculators like <a href="https://www.desmos.com/" target="_blank"> Desmos </a>
        or the built-in Grapher on Mac OS (I call it a hidden treasure). If you would like to have an actual calculator,
        I recommend getting a TI-83+ or TI-84+. Unless otherwise specified, calculators are allowed for all assignments,
        including exams and quizzes.</p>
    <h3>Attendance</h3>
    <p>I understand that there may be times when you miss a class due to emergencies, illnesses, and other reasons. For this reason, I post the lecture notes online. If you miss a class, be sure to submit any work that was due that day, find out what work you missed, and catch yourself up. You can use my office hours or work with others in class to help catch yourself up.

</p>
 <h3>Homework</h3>   
    <p>Homework will be assigned on each topic. Instructions will be posted on Brightspace; it’s your responsibility to check Brightspace regularly. Detailed solutions should be written up neatly, showing <b>ALL</b> of the work. Submitting just answers to the problems will <b>not be counted as homework</b>.<br/>
If you miss a class, it is <b>your</b> responsibility to locate and submit those assignments on time. Missing a class does not grant you an automatic extension on homework submission. 

</p>
    <h3>Late Homework Policy</h3>
    <p>Mathematics is extremely cumulative, so it is important to stay on top of your work when it is assigned. If you miss a class or fall behind, you still need to stay on top of the work that was covered. Do your best to stay current with the work, using all the resources at your disposal to help you.<br/>
If, due to emergencies or illnesses, you require some flexibility, you can reach out to me and we can discuss what you can do to make things up. However, if you fall behind on work and submit work late, I will have less time to actually look at it, grade it and provide meaningful feedback. If work is submitted too late, I reserve the right to simply give it a zero and move on if I do not have time to look at it.
</p>
    <h3>Collaboration Policy/Academic Integrity</h3>
 <p>You are encouraged to discuss homework assignments and problem sets with other students. You must complete the assignment on your own, however.
     There is a clear difference between copying someone else’s work and discussing a problem with another person. The latter is encouraged.
     Plagiarizing another student’s work can lead to academic sanctions as per <a href="https://www.purchase.edu/live/blurbs/840-academic-and-professional-integrity" target="_blank"> Purchase College’s Academic Integrity Policy </a>
Collaboration is not allowed on any exam, including take-home exams. We take cheating seriously!

     
</p>
    <h3>Accessibility Statement</h3>
    <p>It is my goal that this class be an accessible and a welcoming experience for all students, including those with disabilities.
        You are welcome to talk to me at any point in the semester about course design concerns, but it is always best if we can talk as soon as possible
        about the need for any modifications. The Office of Disability Resources collaborates directly with students who identify documented
        disabilities to create accommodation plans, including testing accommodations, for students to access course content and validly demonstrate
        learning. For those students who may require accommodations, please call or email the Office of Disability Resources, (914) 251-6035,
        <a href="mailto:EMAIL_ADDRESS">odr@purchase.edu</a>.</p>

    <h3>Mental Health and Well-Being</h3>
    <p> College faculty and staff recognize that mental health and stress can impact college performance and interfere with daily life activities. 
        At Purchase, Counseling & Behavioral Health Services can provide support if you’re struggling with feeling overwhelmed, anxious, 
        depressed, lost, stuck, or in a crisis. Please call (914)251-6390 or visit <a href="" target="_blank">Counseling and Behavioral Health Services (CBHS)</a> 
        for more information. CBHS services are free and confidential. </br>
    We support all students experiencing emergencies. Services include therapy, support groups, stress reduction at the Harbor Center, and other activities.  The Counseling Center in Humanities Lower Level is open M-F, from 9:00 a.m.– 5:00 p.m. for appointments and walk-up scheduling, or call (914) 251-6390.  The Harbor Center Sanctuary in Fort Awesome is available for stress reduction, mindfulness, and meditation training, free drop-in classes and support groups, and relaxation.
</p>
    <h3>Tutoring Support</h3>
    <p>Tutoring is available in the Einstein Corner, located in the Natural Sciences Building, room 3046. I also suggest forming study groups with each other and coming to office hours regularly.

</p>
    <h3>Grading Policy</h3>
    <p><ul>
  <li>30% Written homework (8-10 assignments), quizzes, and class participation</li>
 <li>20% Online homework</li>
 <li>20% Problem Presentations (4-6 short explanations of a homework/exam/other challenging problem)</li>
        <li>15% Mid-semester exams (3 exams during the semester) </li>
        <li>15% Final Exam (open-book /notes)</li>   
    </ul>
    Submitting homework using LaTeX will add 5 points to your final score. <br/>
    Showing me your neat and complete lecture notes before the end of the semester will add another 5 points to your final score. <br/>
    To get an ‘A+’ you must demonstrate a deep understanding of the material and actually solve extra credit problems on tests. 
  <strong> A missed exam will be counted as zero unless there is legal documentation of a medical or other emergency.</strong>  
If you are unprepared for the test for some reason, please discuss it with me before the test. As mathematicians, we can always find a solution.

    <h3>Tentative Nature of Syllabus</h3>
    <p>If needed, this syllabus, grade allocation, and course outline may be revised to better suit the class. Students are responsible for keeping up with any changes distributed via email or in class. The most up-to-date syllabus will always be posted on Brightspace.</p>
    <h3>Cell Phone Policy During the Class</h3>
    <p>Cellphones are like toddlers—always looking for trouble—so keep them silenced and out of sight during class. If your phone rings, you’ll owe us a performance (karaoke, anyone?). Emergencies are the only exception, but Instagram and memes can wait—focus on the real learning happening here! 📵</p>
